# Project: VANE

Network Certification Tool

## Description

A weather vane is an instrument used for showing the direction of the wind.
Just like a weather vane, Vane is a network certification tool that shows a
network's readiness for production based on validation tests.

## Installation

Let user know how to install

## Development

### Vane Commands

1. Running help command.

```
    python3 vane.py --help
```

2. Running with custom definitions file.

```
    python3 vane.py --definitions_file definitions.yaml
```

3. Listing the inputs from excel_definitions file.

```
    python3 vane.py --input
```

4. Listing the available test markers.

```
    python3 vane.py --marker
```

5. Running specific markers (specific test suites)
	

    Change the 'mark' parameter value in definitions.yaml file to one of the above supported markers (for example, 'nrfu') and then run vane.py script

```
    python3 vane.py
```

### Testing Vane Package

Testing can be run from a the docker development container or from python
virtual environments.

Build and run the docker development container using:
```
    make dev
    ...
    project # 
```

First step is to install Vane. If you are just running tests and will not be
modifying the source, running in a pipeline, then use the following command:
```
    project # make install
```

If you are debugging and modifying the source then use the following command to
install from source. You can use 'pip list' to check if vane was installed.
ONLY USE ONE OF THE INSTALLATION APPROACHES.
```
    project # pip install -e .
```

Running the unit tests:
```
    project # make unittest
```

The system tests require virtual or physical EOS switches to test on. For
testing the Vane package we typically use vEOS devices. The default Makefile
uses the Arista Cloud Test environment for testing.

Running the system tests:
```
    project # make systest
```

Running the unit and system tests together.
```
    project # make tests
```

The coverage report is printed after running the unittest or systest. You can
run the coverage report at any time after running the tests.
```
    project # make coverage_report
```

### Test Directory Hierarchy

├── systests

└── unittests
    └── fixtures
        ├── reports
        │   └── results
        └── spreadsheets
```

The tests/fixtures file contains fixtures that are used by both the unittest
and the systest.

### Build Docker Container

The docker container approach for development can be used to ensure that
everybody is using the same development environment while still being flexible
enough to use the repo you are making changes in. You can inspect the
Dockerfile to see what packages have been installed. Note that specifying the
build arguments allows you to run the container as your user-id and not as the
default user docker.

```
    $ docker build -t repo-name . --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) --build-arg UNAME=$(id -un)
```

### Run the Docker Container

Start up the docker container from the root of the repo directory with the
following command.

```
    $ docker run -it --volume "$(pwd):/repo-name" repo-name
```
