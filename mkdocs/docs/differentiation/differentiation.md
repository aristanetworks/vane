### **Versatility in Testing Scenarios**

*Traditional and Advanced Tests:* While NRFU testing focuses on basic readiness, our framework extends its capabilities to conduct a wide range of tests, including performance, security, scalability, and hardware tests. This ensures that the network is not only ready but optimized for diverse scenarios.

### **Real-world Network Testing**

*Physical and Virtual Environments:* Our framework breaks the barrier between virtual and physical networks. It not only lets you test your virtual network twin but also allows for testing on actual hardware, ensuring that the network's real-world performance matches expectations. This is crucial for industries where physical infrastructure plays a significant role.

### **Holistic Network-wide Validation**

*Beyond Single Device Testing:* Our framework takes a holistic approach by communicating with and testing the entire network, not just individual devices. This ensures that the network as a whole is thoroughly validated, identifying potential bottlenecks, inter-device dependencies, and overall system efficiency.
