This branch **coverage-badge** is for hosting the coverage badge for the Vane repository. It is
automatically updated by CI automation when changes are merged into the **develop** branch.

The only items in this branch are this README file and the coverage.svg file. The
coverage badge is referenced in the VANE README directly from this branch.

This branch should not be deleted, and should not be manually updated.
